% Talks about how lack of training data is a challenge in training machine learning models

Although a technique of Gaussian mixture was employed to augment the theoretical data, (24) it may not fully reflect the real experiments when distinguished features arise from the experiments."

abstract = {Abstract Reliable chemical state analysis of Sn semiconductors by XPS is hindered by the marginal observed binding energy shift in the Sn 3d region. For hybrid Sn-based perovskites especially, errors associated with charge referencing can easily exceed chemistry-related shifts. Studies based on the modified Auger parameter α ′ provide a suitable alternative and have been used previously to resolve different chemical states in Sn alloys and oxides. However, the meaningful interpretation of Auger parameter variations on Sn-based perovskite semiconductors requires fundamental studies. In this work, a comprehensive Auger parameter study is performed through systematic compositional variations of Sn halide perovskites. It is found that in addition to the oxidation state, α ′ is highly sensitive to the composition of the halide site, inducing shifts of up to Δα ′ = 2 eV between ASnI3 and ASnBr3 type perovskites. The reported dependencies of α ′ on the Sn oxidation state, coordination and local chemistry provide a framework that enables reliable tracking of degradation as well as X-site composition for Sn-based perovskites and related compounds. The higher robustness and sensitivity of such studies not only enables more in-depth surface analysis of Sn-based perovskites than previously performed, but also increases reproducibility across laboratories.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Top-performing deep architectures are trained on massive amounts of labeled data. In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available. Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary).As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of "deep" features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard back propagation.Overall, the approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages. The method performs very well in a series of image classification experiments, achieving adaptation effect in the presence of big domain shifts and outperforming previous state-of-the-art on Office datasets.},

abstract = {Abstract Many crystalline solids cannot be prepared in the form of single crystals of sufficient size and/or quality for investigation using single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, and the opportunity to carry out structure determination using powder diffraction data is therefore essential to understand the structural properties of such materials. Although the refinement stage of the structure determination process can be carried out fairly routinely from powder diffraction data using the Rietveld profile refinement technique, solving crystal structures directly from powder data is associated with several intrinsic difficulties. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made in recent years in the scope and potential of techniques in this field. This article aims to highlight the types of structural problems for which structure determination may now be tackled directly from powder diffraction data, and contemporary applications across several chemical disciplines are presented. A brief survey of the underlying methodologies is given, with some emphasis on recently developed techniques for carrying out the structure-solution stage of the structure-determination process.},
